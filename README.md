I'd Like to know the limits of technology, so I'll make things and even program them just to destroy even the smallest device, with or without taking it apart :) 
I study cybersecurity - made quite a few python projects myself... Not sure if I'm gonna put it  on a repository on github though. ps: I probably won't. 
I use Kali linux. 
I do a lot of penetration testing. 
I just love the feeling of discovering Vulnerabilities.

That's all me -
